# PredictLabels
A linguitics model designed to decide whether a given sentence (in native language) is syntactic or not.<br />
<br />
The model is built so that it self-trains itself (machine learning) using certain corpora and probabilistic computations. When a new sentence is given as an input, it is labeled as "1" if it is likely to be syntatic or "0" if it is likely to be non-syntactic.<br />
