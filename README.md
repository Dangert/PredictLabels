# PredictLabels
A linguitics model designed to decide whether a given sentence (in native language) is syntactic or not.<br />
The model is built by self-training (machine learning) using certain corpora and probabilistic computations. When a new sentence is given as an input, the model gives the label "1" for a sentence which is more likely to be syntactic and "0" for non-syntactic.<br />
